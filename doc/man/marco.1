.SH "NAME"
Marco \- The MATE Window Manager
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.B marco [OPTIONS]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Marco is a minimal X window manager that uses GTK+ for drawing window frames. It is aimed at non-technical users and is designed to integrate well with the MATE desktop. Marco is a plain window manager for the adult in you; Many window managers are like Marshmallow Froot Loops, Marco is like Cheerios. It lacks some features that may be expected by traditional UNIX or other technical users; these users may want to investigate other available window managers for use with MATE or as a standalone window manager.
.PP
Marco supports several somewhat advanced but common features such as Window Shading/Roll-Up, Window/Edge Snapping, Vertical and Horizontal Maximize, Always-On-Top, Sloppy/Mouse Focus and Raising, and many more... Well, not a lot, but some more.

This manual page documents the \fBmarco\fR command.
