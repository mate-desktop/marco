      <summary>Modifier to use for modified window click actions</summary>
      <description>Clicking a window while holding down this modifier key will move the window (left click), resize the window (middle click), or show the window menu (right click). The middle and right click operations may be swapped using the "resize_with_right_button" key. Modifier is expressed as "&lt;Alt&gt;" or "&lt;Super&gt;" for example.</description>

      <summary>Arrangement of buttons on the titlebar</summary>
      <description>Arrangement of buttons on the titlebar. The value should be a string, such as "menu:minimize,maximize,spacer,close"; the colon separates the left corner of the window from the right corner, and the button names are comma-separated. Duplicate buttons are not allowed. Unknown button names are silently ignored so that buttons can be added in future marco versions without breaking older versions. A special spacer tag can be used to insert some space between two adjacent buttons.</description>

    <key name="focus-mode" enum="org.mate.Marco.FocusMode">
      <default>'click'</default>
      <summary>Window focus mode</summary>
      <description>The window focus mode indicates how windows are activated. It has three possible values; "click" means windows must be clicked in order to focus them, "sloppy" means windows are focused when the mouse enters the window, and "mouse" means windows are focused when the mouse enters the window and unfocused when the mouse leaves the window.</description>

      <summary>Control how new windows get focus</summary>
      <description>This option provides additional control over how newly created windows get focus.  It has two possible values; "smart" applies the user's normal focus mode, and "strict" results in windows started from a terminal not being given focus.</description>
    </key>
    <key name="raise-on-click" type="b">
      <default>true</default>
      <summary>Whether raising should be a side-effect of other user interactions</summary>
      <description>Setting this option to false can lead to buggy behavior, so users are strongly discouraged from changing it from the default of true. Many actions (e.g. clicking in the client area, moving or resizing the window) normally raise the window as a side-effect. Setting this option to false, which is strongly discouraged, will decouple raising from other user actions, and ignore raise requests generated by applications. See http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=445447#c6. Even when this option is false, windows can still be raised by an alt-left-click anywhere on the window, a normal click on the window decorations, or by special messages from pagers, such as activation requests from tasklist applets. This option is currently disabled in click-to-focus mode. Note that the list of ways to raise windows when raise_on_click is false does not include programmatic requests from applications to raise windows; such requests will be ignored regardless of the reason for the request.  If you are an application developer and have a user complaining that your application does not work with this setting disabled, tell them it is _their_ fault for breaking their window manager and that they need to change this option back to true or live with the "bug" they requested.</description>

      <description>This option determines the effects of double-clicking on the title bar.  Current valid options are 'toggle_shade', which will shade/unshade the window, 'toggle_maximize' which will maximize/unmaximize the window, 'toggle_maximize_horizontally' and 'toggle_maximize_vertically' which will maximize/unmaximize the window in that direction only, 'minimize' which will minimize the window, 'shade' which will roll the window up, 'menu' which will display the window menu, 'lower' which will put the window behind all the others, and 'none' which will not do anything.</description>

      <summary>Automatically raises the focused window</summary>
      <description>If set to true, and the focus mode is either "sloppy" or "mouse" then the focused window will be automatically raised after a delay specified by the auto_raise_delay key. This is not related to clicking on a window to raise it, nor to entering a window during drag-and-drop.</description>

    <key name="wrap-style" enum="org.mate.Marco.WrapStyle">
      <default>'no wrap'</default>
      <summary>Workspace wrap style</summary>
      <description>The wrap style is used to determine how to switch from one workspace to another at the border of the workspace switcher. When set to "no wrap", nothing will happen if you try to switch to a workspace past the border of the workspace switcher. If set to "classic", the old marco behavior is used: the end of one row leads to the beginning of the next and the end of a column leads to the beginning of the next. If set to "toroidal", workspaces are connected like a doughnut: the end of each row leads to its own beginning and the end of each column leads to its own beginning.</description>

      <summary>Visual Bell Type</summary>
      <description>Tells Marco how to implement the visual indication that the system bell or another application 'bell' indicator has been rung.  Currently there are two valid values, "fullscreen", which causes a fullscreen white-black flash, and "frame_flash" which causes the titlebar of the application which sent the bell signal to flash.  If the application which sent the bell is unknown (as is usually the case for the default "system beep"), the currently focused window's titlebar is flashed.</description>

      <description>If set to true, no window thumbnails will be displayed in the alt-tab popup window when the compositing manager is enabled. Application icons will be displayed instead. Note that on high resolution screens with many visible windows there can be a perceptible lag in rendering.</description>
    </key>
    <key name="reduced-resources" type="b">
      <default>false</default>
      <summary>If true, trade off usability for less resource usage</summary>
      <description>If true, marco will give the user less feedback by using wireframes, avoiding animations, or other means.  This is a significant reduction in usability for many users, but may allow legacy applications to continue working, and may also be a useful tradeoff for terminal servers.  However, the wireframe feature is disabled when accessibility is on.</description>
    </key>
    <key name="application-based" type="b">
      <default>false</default>
      <summary>(Not implemented) Navigation works in terms of applications not windows</summary>
      <description>If true, then Marco works in terms of applications rather than windows. The concept is a bit abstract, but in general an application-based setup is more like the Mac and less like Windows. When you focus a window in application-based mode, all the windows in the application will be raised. Also, in application-based mode, focus clicks are not passed through to windows in other applications. Application-based mode is, however, largely unimplemented at the moment.</description>

    <key name="disable-workarounds" type="b">
      <default>false</default>
      <summary>Disable misfeatures that are required by old or broken applications</summary>

"automatic" means the system chooses a location automatically based on the space available on the desktop, or by a simple cascade if there is no space; "pointer" means that new windows are placed according to the mouse pointer position; "manual" means that the user must manually place the new window with the mouse or keyboard.</description>
