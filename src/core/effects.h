/**
 * \file effects.h "Special effects" other than compositor effects.
 *
 * Before we had a serious compositor, we supported swooping
 * rectangles for minimising and so on.  These are still supported
 * today, even when the compositor is enabled.  The file contains two
 * parts:
 *
 *  1) A set of functions, each of which implements a special effect.
 *     (Only the minimize function does anything interesting; we should
 *      probably get rid of the rest.)
 *
 *  2) A set of functions for moving a highlighted wireframe box around
 *     the screen, optionally with height and width shown in the middle.
 *     This is used for moving and resizing when reduced_resources is set.
 *
 * There was formerly a system which allowed callers to drop in their
 * own handlers for various things; it was never used (people who want
 * their own handlers can just modify this file, after all) and it added
 * a good deal of extra complexity, so it has been removed.  If you want it,
 * it can be found in svn r3769.
