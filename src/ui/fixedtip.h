/**
 * \file fixedtip.h  Marco fixed tooltip routine
 *
 * Sometimes we want to display a small floating rectangle with helpful
 * text near the pointer.  For example, if the user holds the mouse over
 * the maximise button, we can display a tooltip saying "Maximize".
 * The text is localised, of course.
 *
 * This file contains the functions to create and delete these tooltips.
 *
 * \todo  Since we now consider MetaDisplay a singleton, there can be
 *        only one tooltip per display; this might quite simply live in
 *        display.c.  Alternatively, it could move to frames.c, which
 *        is the only place this business is called anyway.
 *
 * \todo  Apparently some UI needs changing (check bugzilla)
