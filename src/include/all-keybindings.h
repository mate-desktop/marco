/**
 * A list of screen keybinding information.
 *
 * Each action which can have a keystroke bound to it is listed below.
 * To use this file, define keybind() to be a seven-argument macro (you can
 * throw any of the arguments you please away), include this file,
 * and then undefine the macro again.
 *
 * (If you aren't familiar with this technique, sometimes called "x-macros",
 * see DDJ of May 2001: <http://www.ddj.com/cpp/184401387>.)
 *
 * This makes it possible to keep all information about all the keybindings
 * in the same place.  The only exception is the code to run when an action
 * is actually invoked; while we *could* have put that in this file, it would
 * have made debugging ridiculously difficult.  Instead, each action should
 * have a corresponding static function named handle_<name>() in
 * keybindings.c.
 *
 * The arguments to keybind() are:
 *   1) the name of the binding; a bareword identifier
 *              (it's fine if it happens to clash with a C reserved word)
 *   2) the name of the function which implements it.
 *              Clearly we could have guessed this from the binding very often,
 *              but we choose to write it in full for the benefit of grep.
 *   3) an integer parameter to pass to the handler
 *   4) a set of boolean flags, ORed together:
 *       BINDING_PER_WINDOW  - this is a window-based binding.
 *                             It is only valid if there is a
 *                             current window, and will operate in
 *                             some way on that window.
 *       BINDING_REVERSES    - the binding can reverse if you hold down Shift
 *       BINDING_IS_REVERSED - the same, but the senses are reversed from the
 *                             handler's point of view (let me know if I should
 *                             explain this better)
 *      or 0 if no flag applies.
 *
 * Don't try to do XML entity escaping anywhere in the strings.
